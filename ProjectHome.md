## Obfuscation made easy. ##

IntelliGuard integrates [yGuard](http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yguard_about.html) - a free Java bytecode obfuscator - with IntelliJ IDEA. Key features are:
  * No more hazzles with configuration files. Just hit ALT+ENTER on any symbol in the editor for keep options.
  * Refactor support. Kept symbols remain unobfuscated after rename or move.
  * Inspections for common obfuscation mistakes.
  * Optional (toggleable) gutter icons for obfuscated symbols.
  * Export configuration for [yGuard](http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yguard_about.html) and [ProGuard](http://proguard.sourceforge.net/) format.

The plugin is free and the binaries may be downloaded with IntelliJ Plugin Manager or from [IntelliJ IDEA Plugin Repository](http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin/?idea&id=4511).
